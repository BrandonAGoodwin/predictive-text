Remove popularity on a removed word
Test value when user doesn't input anything
An empty string CANNOT be a word
	Can't remove an empty string (Issue, c
The empty node at the beginning is counted in the size of the tree so the tree can't be smaller than size 1
insert still goes through the code if the word already exists
	(Could make helper method that runs the code and insert checks if the tree already contains the word)
Contains returns false if the word is in the tree but it's last node doesn't have wordEnd set to true
